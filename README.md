Briefly describe what the code is supposed to do.
The code shall be initialising a swarm session. It would have a section in which the user can enter the description of the swarm. A link in which the user can enter a zoom link or a vs code liveshare link so that other members of the team can enter the coding section with ease. Also, it shall contain a start time and end time entered by the user to serve as the estimated time of the swarm sessio

Does the code work? If not, what's broken?
It technically works but it lacks the connection built to the firebase + the CSS styling is off but GPT fails to understand my request 

How is the code better than what the team currently has?
I think it is not better since the team's code contains all the functionality this app has to offer but given this only took 5 minutes, it is certainly faster 

How is the code worse?
Similarly to my previous comment, the code is generally worse comparing to the team code. But given the time it took, it is efficent. 


How many tries did it take to get the code? Main struggles?
I think it started running on the first try. Then, when I asked for some CSS-styling, it imported a library that ran into dependency error. However, GPT was able to fix it based on error by identifying it is a package that is not supported in REACT 18. 

Overall impression of the experience
I would say it is certainly a fun experiment playing around GPT and looking at the capacity GPT has to offer. I would say I definitely have seen potential within the application, and I believe it can serve as a valuable tool that boosts the effiency of individual programmers.
